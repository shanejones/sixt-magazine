The rest can be found throughout the American West and in Hawaii. Kīlauea, in Hawaii, is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth and is seen by millions of tourists each year. If you plan on visiting, take advantage of the daily ranger-led hikes, check the underground cavernous lava tubes and caverns, and explore the old, dried-up lava flows and lava lakes that emit a reddish-orange glow at night.
